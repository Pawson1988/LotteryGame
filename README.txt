Just a small lottery game that generates 49 lottery number (or however many you wish) 
then gets a set number of array with a length of 6 then gets a lucky random array from those arrays
after it checks the lucky array againt a chosen array of 6 numbers
I use underscoreJS to find the difference and return only numbers that are not the same
to get how many numbers are the same I simply do a clacualtion of original array and array after checking.
to play the game you enter 6 numbers into the command line as arguments and these will be your chosen 6 numbers
